# Overview {#mainpage}

This library is in the early stages of development, but what better time to start end-user documentation? Currently the most useful things about the library are the nkr::atomic_t and the nkr::pointer_t. These two types have fairly thorough tests in the sister project nkr_test ensuring their functionality, and I'm thinking about making a separate set of documentation for that as well.

More to come as I implement more features! For now I'm going to document the types that are pretty solid.
