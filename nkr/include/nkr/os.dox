    * @brief
    *   Functions that provide atomic access, assignment, and exchange of variables.
    * 
    * @details
    *   These functions can be used in a threaded environment to safely read and write to various integers, booleans, and pointers. They are far more resource friendly than locks and should be used in their place as frequently as possible.
    * 
    *   There are three primary sets of these functions, each differing in whether they write to the atomic or simply read from it, and what value they return after a write. Furthermore within each set there are subsets that allow for either a read or write to be combined with a integral operator, all done in one atomic operation. Each subset consists of various overloads to provide atomics not only for booleans and integers, but for real numbers and pointers as well.
    * 
    * @note
    *   Any 64-bit functionality only works when compiling for 64-bit processors. This is because the nkr::word_t of the machine is the maximum number of bits that can be used atomically.
    * @par
    * 
    * @note
    *   In the description for each function is an expression that equates semantically but not literally. Even though there are sometimes several operations in some of the expressions, each function is still atomically thread-safe.
    * @par
    * 
    * @note
    *   Without exception, every right-hand operand is statically cast to the left-hand sides underlying type, which conforms to operating system functions which may or may not be available. Either way, the pattern remains consistent.

Some of these functions have direct operating system calls they can use while others are implemented using the Exchange_If_Equals functions. An implementor of the library can make use of this assortment of funcitons to add optimizations that even the operating system and compiler are missing by talking directly to the processor.
        * 
        * In any case, even the functions that are implemented with the Exchange_If_Equals functions are way faster than using other locking techniques and so everything in here is a good alternative if you can design your program to use them, either directly or through the nkr::atomic_T interface.

            *   There are a few limitations to the number of bytes you can allocate depending on:
            * 
            *   1. how much ram is physically in the computer
            *   2. how much space the operating system has left to give
            *   3. the settings that your compiler operates with
            *   4. what the natural word size of the processor is
            * 
            *   At most the largest number of bytes you will be able to allocate is the max number that can fit in an nkr::count_t (an alias of nkr::word_t). If you are running on a 32 bit processor you will only be able to allocate one byte shy of 4gb, which is no where near the amount of memory you can allocate on a 64 bit processor. Furthermore, limitations may come into play depending on the operating system, which may significantly decrease that amount even further.
