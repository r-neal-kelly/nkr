# nkr
This is my new C++20 library. I'm excited to use concepts finally! This is aiming to be cross-platform although currently there is only development for Windows.

[Go to documentation](https://r-neal-kelly.github.io/nkr_docs)

### Building
This library currently has no other code requirements, and is thus extremely straightforward to build for Windows, currently the only supported platform. However, you will need a Visual Studio 2022 instance to build unless you are willing to go through the trouble of backporting all of the project files.
