This is my new C++20 library. I'm excited to use concepts finally! This is aiming to be cross-platform although currently there is only development for Windows. The api and program structure is being designed to easily allow platform expansion in the future. I'm also using some Test Driven Development techniques to make sure the library is working properly and I'm also trying to document the code as I go, using Doxygen.
