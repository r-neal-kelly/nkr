# nkr
This is my new C++20 library. I'm excited to use concepts finally! This is aiming to be cross-platform although currently there is only development for Windows.

### Building
- After loading the solution in Visual Studio, as of the latest version of their C++20 compiler there are still disagreements between the compiler and the intellisense. So you will see quite a few intellisense errors where there are none during compilation. Almost all of these with very exceptions are contained in the library's definition files and don't leak into user-end code.
